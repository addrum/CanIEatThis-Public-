## CanIEatThis Privacy Policy

### Personal Information
No personal information is collected by the app. 

### Location Data
Location data is only collected if the user grants the "location" permission. This
location data is used only to show the user nearby "places to eat" (including
restaurants and shops) and is not stored at any point throughout the use of
the application. 

When submitting information on a restaurant, the location of the "place" (in this instance, the restaurant or shop where a marker is placed on the map seen in the application) is stored for users to continue to add further information to. The user's location is **not** stored in any way.

### Product Data
All data viewed and/or submitted in relation to a product or barcode is done so anonymously.

When granting the camera permission, the data viewed through the camera is not stored and the barcode scanning functionality ceases upon the successful scanning of a barcode, or, when the user dismisses the camera by pressing the back or home buttons.

### Storage Access
Storage access is only granted by the user and is only used to store the product database for offline use.

### Network Access
The network related permissions are only used to check the connectivity of the device in order to handle requests for data that is stored in a database not available on the device.
