This repository is to host the issues and bug tracking for CanIEatThis (Android App) whilst keeping the code private. 

CanIEatThis is an Android app created as a final year project at university. It allows the user to scan a barcode, fetch the ingredients and tells the user whether the product is suitable for Vegetarians (will be expanded to encompass Vegans, gluten-free etc).
